#Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python?

Inheritance in Python is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit the attributes and methods of another class. It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented
programming (OOP) that promotes code reusability and hierarchy. Inheritance creates a relationship between a parent (base or superclass) class and one or more child
(derived or subclass) classes. The child class inherits the properties and behaviors
of the parent class, and it can also add new attributes or methods or override the ones inherited.


init method:
    
The init method, also known as the constructor in Python, is a special method that gets called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the
attributes of the object. In the example above, the __init__ method in the Animal class takes a name parameter and sets the name attribute of the object. This allows you to
initialize objects with a name when you create instances of the Animal, Dog, or Cat classes.
